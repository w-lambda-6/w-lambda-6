## Past Projects:
Here you can find all the past projects I have worked on:
 - [University of Michigan Deep Learning Course on Computer Vision](https://github.com/w-lambda-6/UMich498-007-Homework) -Assignments for this course, mainly involves using Pytorch ML/DL frame work and building all kinds of AI models with certain algorithms in Jupyter notebook and google colab.
 - [XV6 Unix like operating system](https://github.com/w-lambda-6/XV6) -Projects for the OS course from MIT 6.S081, added new features to a half complete OS to improve performance and increase functionality.
 - [Bustub DBMS](https://github.com/w-lambda-6/Bustub) -Projects from the CMU DB course 15445, added new features like buffer pool managers, query optimizers, lock managers to make it functional and efficient.
 - [AI Spam Email Classifier](https://github.com/lpwee/email-classifier) -University collaborative project, built an NLP agent that classifies emails with 97% accuracy using various data processing methods and ML algorithms
 - [AI Sudoku Solver](https://github.com/w-lambda-6/Sudoku-Solver) -University collaborative project, built an AI with state that solves sudoku efficiently with various informed and uninformed search methods.
 - [Princeton Algorithms I & II](https://github.com/w-lambda-6/Algorithms-I-II) -Projects from the princeton classic online course, makes use of some common but important data structures and algorithms, as well as the princeton standard library.
 - [CMU15213 Computer Systems Lab Projects](https://github.com/w-lambda-6/CMU15213-Labs-) -Lab Projects from the classic computer systems course 15-213 from CMU, achieved many computer system level functionalities through c programming in linux.
