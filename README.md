# Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Ma Gaoyuan
My name is **Ma Gaoyuan**, you may call me **Tony**. I'm currently an undergraduate in computer science at **Nanyang Technological University** (NTU), Singapore. I'm diligent and love to learn. Interested in **AI, Databases, software development.**
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a high performance redis-like in-memory data structure
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning DL, pytorch, high performance C/C++ programming in the linux environment 
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: mcx825798@gmail.com

## Past Projects:
 - [Redis like in-memory database](https://github.com/w-lambda-6/Redis-Like-Database) - A redis like database that supports Redis queries like `GET`, `SET`, `DEL`, `KEYS` through Redis protocol handling. With a high performance server with high QPS via methods like **non-blocking IO**, **event loops**, event-driven programming(**Linux poll() system call**), **thread pools**. It stores key-value pairs efficently with an **external chaining hash table** that uses **embedded intrusive linked lists**, and uses **AVL trees** to store certain key types for more efficient lookup. Through its **TLV(tag-length-value) data serialisation format**, it achieves support for various data types like `int`, `double`, `array` and `hash table`. It also utilises a **timer and a TTL cache** to store frequently accessed data to reduce query latency.

 - [Campsite Sharing Web App](https://github.com/w-lambda-6/Campsite-sharing-application) -A web application developed using **React.js** and **Django** able to show map information using **Google Maps API**, used **MongoDB** for storage and **Redis** for performance and caching, used **docker** for backend and databases, later to be deployed on **GCP**
 
 - [Student Grade Management System](https://github.com/w-lambda-6/Student-Grade-Management-System) -A web application developed using **Vue.js** and **flask**, used **MySQL** for storage, later to be deployed on the **AWS** cloud 
 
 - [University of Michigan Deep Learning Course on Computer Vision](https://github.com/w-lambda-6/UMich498-007-Homework) -Assignments for this course, mainly involves using Pytorch ML/DL frame work and building all kinds of AI models with certain algorithms in Jupyter notebook and google colab.
 
 - [AI Spam Email Classifier](https://github.com/lpwee/email-classifier) -University collaborative project, built an NLP agent that classifies emails with 97% accuracy using various data processing methods and ML algorithms
